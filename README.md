# logAnalyzer

This repository containes a practical exercise from ["Software Architecture & Development" MSc](http://www.etsisi.upm.es/titulo-experto-en-arquitectura-y-desarrollo-software) I had to implement during 2015/16 course.

# Introduction
The exercise consists in the implementation of a log processing system that should allow:
* One or more applications sending logs
* One or more systems sending logs
* Flexible configuration of the log processing pipeline (remove, change or add steps)
* Flexible log analysis (possibility of changing a running analisis service)
